# Hangman

## Description
The classic hangman game made using HTML, CSS, and vanilla JS. A random 1 or 2 word phrase is chosen and the user has to guess in 10 tries. As the user guesses words correct, the amount of tries they receive for the next round decreases and vice versa. User input is validated so that non a-Z characters and repeat characters won't be entered.
